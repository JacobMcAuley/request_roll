# Request Roll
Request Roll is a module designed to help Gamemasters speed up the rolling process by requesting rolls from PCs. This can help reduce player navigation time, questions about where a roll is located, and other unforseen delays that cause chokepoitns in your game. You can select from a range of options varying from hidden rolls, where only the gm knows, to rolls with advantage or disadvantage! Consider installing this module to speed along your game!

**Important:** This module was suggested by user iotech, of the FVTT discord server, which was based off the ["Roll For Initiative"](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?45234-5E-Request-Roll-Extension-WIP) extension for Fantasy Grounds. Additionally, user Kakaroto has created a similar module dubbed ["Let me roll that for you!"](https://github.com/kakaroto/fvtt-module-lmrtfy) with identical reasonings! If my module doesn't work suit your needs, or even if it does, please consider giving his a looksee to determine which module best suits you!

**As GM:**
1. Navigate to the player control tab.
2. Click the D20. A prompt should appear.
3. Select the desired Players by click the portraits. A red outline should appear when selected
4. Select the desired rolls in the Attributes/Saves/Skills categories. A purple/gray should fill in when selected
5. Adjust the modifiers as desired in the Modifiers Section
6. Select the DC as desired in the Modifiers Section
7. Click the submit button to send the message off to your players!

**As Player:**
1. Receive the prompt requesting rolls
2. Click on the player portrait that you wish to roll for (ONLY APPLIES IF MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER IS SELECTED)
3. Click the corresponding buttons below the portrait(s) to roll.
4. Hope for the highest rolls!

### Settings
Two options can be enabled within the module's settings
1. Owned vs Active Tokens mode.
2. Auto Resolve DC

**Owned vs Active**
Disabled by default: Owned vs Active mode determines the portraits that are displayed during the GM portion of requesting rolls. If the GM would like to see all player owned tokens, opposed to those that are currently active through the player select screen, they may choose to do so.

**Auto Resolve DC**
Enabled by default:  Auto Resolve DC, as it implies, automatically resolves the rolls based off the set DC. The returned result after a player makes the roll will be difference between the roll and dc. It will be red if it fails, otherwise the number is the margin of success!
